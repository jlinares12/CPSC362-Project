            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>A strong and supportive community is a vital aspect of all lifestyles, and community gardens are a great example of the good that can sprout from neighborly contributions and efforts. Not only do community gardens provide affordable, locally grown fruits and vegetables, but they also enhance communities through education and collaboration.</p>

                <p>In this modern age, discovering a city's amenities can be as simple as checking the city website, but our team wanted to take accessibility one step further: featuring Community Gardens!</p>

                <p>By utilizing mapping functionalities and community inputs, our website creates an easily accessible compilation of all community gardens in the Southern California area. From general information about your city's garden to information on starting a garden of your own, Community Gardens is a hub for like-minded individuals interested in supporting their community in a healthy and sustainable way.</p>
