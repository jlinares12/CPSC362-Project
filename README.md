## About the website

Our website allows visitors to search for and apply to volunteer at nearby community gardens, with the inclusion of Google Maps functionality. Additionally, visitors can register their garden as a community garden and become their garden "admin" or register to become a volunteer. Other resources include a forum for community discussion and help, a page for monetary and goods donations (although monetary donations will include the services of outside providers), and information about things such as how to start a garden, plant advice, plant hardiness zones, etc.
