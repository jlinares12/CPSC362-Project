## About the website

The Community Garden Website is a platform that helps people find, support, and connect with local community gardens. Users can search for gardens using a map or browse a full list. The site also allows users to sign up to volunteer, make donations, and submit new gardens to be added.

The goal of the website is to make it easier for communities to stay involved with local gardening efforts. Whether someone wants to offer their time, donate resources, or start a new garden, the platform provides simple tools to get started. Registered users can manage their profile, track their activity, and communicate with garden organizers.

Each page of the site has a clear purpose to support these actions, making it a central place for people interested in building and supporting community gardens.
